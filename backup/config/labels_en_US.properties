label1aboutUs=i-Lib
label2aboutUs=i
label3aboutUs=-Lib
label4aboutUs=What This Is?
label5aboutUs=i-Lib
label6aboutUs=is a website that works as an online repository for e-books and facilitates access to books that are freely readable over the Internet. It also aims to encourage the development of such online books, for the benefit and education of all. i-Lib serves as one touch access to a huge collections of books which are free from all the legal issues and are free to download. While every precaution has been taken while allowing a book on the shelves, still the team at i-Lib assume no responsibility for any errors or omissions in any of the book, or for damages resulting form the use of information contained herein. However downloading a book from our site does avail rights to reproduce or alter the content, which may otherwise violate the copyright rights without the prior written permission form the publisher.
label7aboutUs=Who's Responsible and Who Supports it
label8aboutUs=This website is developed by Parul seth, Megha shah and Dheeraj bansal under the guidance of Rahul sharma, Roshit jain and Richa agrawal. The site is hosted by the
label9aboutUs=impetus infotech pvt. ltd
label10aboutUs=who provide the server, disk space, and network bandwidth for the site. They also employ the developers, and support them in their various digital library activities (of which this is but one). The online books listed on this website have been authored, placed online, and hosted, by a wide variety of individuals and groups throughout the world (and throughout history!).
label11aboutUs=Where it Started?
label12aboutUs=The Project i-Lib originally was founded in 2007 by the current team of developers, while these are employed by
label13aboutUs=impetus infotech pvt. ltd.
label14aboutUs=These are responsible to maintain it , with Web space and computing resources provided by the same.
label15aboutUs=What gets Listed?
label16aboutUs=The index of individual titles includes books and definitive collections and major serial archives that meet following criteria.
label17aboutUs=Is it legitimately available at no charge?
label18aboutUs=A book is considered legitimately available if 
label19aboutUs=any one
label20aboutUs= of these conditions holds:
label21aboutUs=It is not copyrighted in the country from which the online book is served. To qualify under this condition, the country must be a signatory of the Berne Convention, or the book must be out of copyright under the minimal standards of that convention. (I don't intend this condition to include loopholes involving countries that have no effective copyright law.) If the book is copyrighted in the US (where this site is located) but not in the Berne member country from where it's served, I'll list it, but include a warning page.
label22aboutUs=The appropriate copyright holder has granted permission for free personal, noncommercial online use. (The exact terms for any copyrighted work may vary. Terms that allow wider use than this are also acceptable.)
label23aboutUs=In some special circumstances, some copyrighted works can also go online without permission under special licenses granted by law. (This last category, for instance, in the US may include certain out-of-print works in their last 20 years of copyright, as per the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act.)
label24aboutUs=Is it a stable, well-formatted text in a standard format?
label25aboutUs=We try to link to the best sites for texts We can find. We will prefer fast, highly available sites over slow sites that are often down. We prefer sites that have straightforward URLs that don't change every few weeks. We prefer sites that have texts in portable, widely supported formats, such as HTML (this is the Web, after all), PDF (which now has a published specification and viewers from various sources) or plain vanilla text. Books in proprietary formats that do not have published specifications, and that can only be read on certain vendor's systems, generally aren't listed here unless they're not available in more open formats. (For example, Microsoft Reader or .lit format is a proprietary format as of this writing, so you won't see many MS Reader books listed unless they're only published online in that format, or Microsoft openly publishes its Reader format specification.) Books that are available only as executable files are generally not listed at all, for reasons of security as well as portability.
label26aboutUs=If there are more accurate sources of a text, or sources that have more useful text features, I'll prefer those to less accurate ones. Online editions which state their provenance (such as what print edition they're based on) are often more reliable than those that do not.
